Long live our father, our tsar!

19
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:16,959
Glory!

20
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,224
Damn!

21
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,105
Hey, what's the matter?
No electricity again!

22
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:23,317
It's outrageous!
Timofeyev has burned the fuses again!

23
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:28,489
- Comrade Timofeyev, when will it end?
- I'm finishing.

24
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:31,534
When will be the end
of your experiments

25
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:34,286
which leave our whole building
without electricity?

26
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:35,913
There you go.

27
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,668
Ivan Vasilyevich, if you knew
what an important invention

28
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,379
I'm working on, you wouldn't have
said that.

29
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:46,674
Experiments with electricity
should be done at your office,

30
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:51,804
and at home electricity must be used
only for peaceful, domestic purposes!

31
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:54,056
How many times did I tell you...

32
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:58,185
I'm on leave, so I work at home.
And anyway, my experiments are safe.

33
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:01,689
As the public representative,
I demand that you stop it!

34
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:05,776
Today you've burned the fuses,
tomorrow you'll burn the house!

35
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:08,446
STUPID

36
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:11,073
And what is this?

37
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:13,367
You see?
That's the result. Pah!

38
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:19,081
I'll need to raise the voltage.

39
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,295
Dangerous! Of course, it's dangerous,
but, as they say, nothing ventured...

40
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:13,135
Your only love
is not so easily found.

41
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:19,141
Our planet's turning,
round and round.

42
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,564
The planet's flying
in everyday beat.

43
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:31,987
It's very hard
to fall in love on it.

44
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:37,118
A winter blizzard is raging,

45
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:40,079
And thunderstorms are blazing,

46
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:45,835
And stars in the sky are racing,
and cities din in the rain.

47
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:49,046
And people don't see each other,

48
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:52,174
They just pass by each other,

49
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:55,469
They always lose each other,

50
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:59,890
Never to find again.

51
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:06,689
But there's somewhere
my only love,

52
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:09,358
My unforgettable,

53
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:13,028
My true big love.

54
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,407
I look for it,

55
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:19,160
But in everyday beat

56
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:24,915
It's hard for us to meet.

57
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:30,755
A winter blizzard is raging,

58
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:33,841
And thunderstorms are blazing,

59
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,427
And stars in the sky are racing,

60
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:40,056
And cities din in the rain.

61
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:43,184
And people don't see each other,

62
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:46,270
They just pass by each other,

63
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:49,065
They always lose each other,

64
00:07:49,398 --> 00:07:54,987
Never to find again.

65
00:07:55,738 --> 00:07:58,324
Never to find again.

66
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:20,888
I can imagine what's going to happen!

67
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:23,307
I hope we can avoid a scandal!

68
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:26,394
Those scandals are so tiresome.

69
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:29,230
I was divorced three times.

70
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:33,234
Yes, that's right, three times.
Zyuzin doesn't count.

71
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:36,112
I've never been as nervous as today.

72
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:40,324
Well, I'm going to do it!

73
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:43,661
Oh, Shurik!

74
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,956
Your apparatus is going to kill you!

75
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:50,960
My apparatus, Zinochka, will make me
famous. And you, too.

76
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:52,962
Really?

77
00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:57,550
I'm sorry to bother you,

78
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,887
but I have terrible news for you.

79
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:07,518
My gloves have been stolen from me
today.

80
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,480
And I fell in love with another man.
Do you understand, Shurik?

81
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:16,485
- Yes, your gloves. What about them?
- Forget the gloves. I love another man.

82
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:19,405
Well, it's done!

83
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:22,283
Only, please, no objections,
and don't make scenes!

84
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:25,870
What?
Are you asking who is the man?

85
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:30,458
You probably think it's Molchanovsky?
No, you're wrong.

86
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,252
Zupperman?
Wrong again.

87
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:36,172
All right!
Let's not beat about the bushes.

88
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:39,592
He is... film director Yakin.

89
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:42,636
Well, well, well.

90
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:49,852
It's strange though. It happens
for the first time in my life.

91
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:54,440
The man is told that his wife is
leaving him, and he says, well, well.

92
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:57,234
At the very least, it's impolite.

93
00:09:57,526 --> 00:10:01,155
You mean that tall, blond man?

94
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:05,826
Unbelievable! To show so little
interest in his own wife!

95
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:10,039
The blond one is Molchanovsky.
Can't you remember it? Molchanovsky.

96
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:14,043
And Yakin is...
Yakin is very talented!

97
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:17,505
What? You ask
where we're going to live?

98
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:22,718
Today we're leaving for Gagry
to look for the film's location.

99
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:27,431
And later, he will be given a flat.
Of course, if he's not lying.

100
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,684
Sure, he is lying!

101
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:33,479
Oh, all this is so ridiculous!

102
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:36,273
To insult a man because you're
jealous!

103
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:39,902
He can't be lying every minute!

104
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:45,491
During my many sleepless nights,
I've been thinking,

105
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:50,913
and I came to the conclusion
that we're no match for each other.

106
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:55,876
Can't you understand, Alexander, that
I live in the world of cinema, of art!

107
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:02,842
But your calmness
just amazes me!

108
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:07,930
You know, Shurik, I even feel like
making a scene.

109
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:11,058
- No, don't do it.
- You think so?

110
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:12,977
- I'm sure.
- A-ha.

111
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:16,939
Goodbye, Shurik.

112
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:25,656
But don't cancel my house registration.
Who knows what might happen.

113
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:32,496
Alexander Sergeyevich!

114
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:34,999
Please, tell Zinaida Mikhailovna
that Rozalia Frantsevna said

115
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:38,753
that Kapitolina Nikiforovna offered
Anna Ivanovna a fur coat...

116
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:41,839
Zinaida Mikhailovna has left.

117
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:44,091
- Where for?
- With her lover.

118
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:47,678
What do you mean, with her lover?
And you're so calm about it?

119
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:52,058
- You're a very strange man.
- Excuse me, I'm very busy.

120
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:55,770
You are some character!

121
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,565
If I were your wife,
I would have left, too.

122
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,652
If you were my wife,
I would have hanged myself.

123
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:06,906
You jerk!

124
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:11,410
Is that the dental clinic?
Hallo?

125
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,829
Extension 3-62?

126
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:23,589
May I speak to Anton Shpak, please?

127
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,676
Anton, that's for you.

128
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:31,222
- Who's calling?
- A woman.

129
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,808
Keep your mouth open.

130
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:36,268
Speaking.

131
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,982
Anton Semyonovich? Hello.
At what time do you finish today?

132
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:48,572
I'm an actress. No, you don't know me,
but I'm dying to meet you.

133
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:59,625
So you work until four?
I'll call again, I'm very persistent.

134
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:01,627
I'm looking forward to it!

135
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:06,924
Well, let's continue.

136
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,525
A.S. Shpak

137
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,130
How lucky for me to drop by!

138
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:25,503
Folks, keep your money in a bank!

139
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:27,922
Naturally, if you have it!

140
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:31,175
What do you care about my relations
with my wife?

141
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:35,012
It's none of your business whether
we're divorcing or not.

142
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:37,807
That's our personal matter.

143
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:42,645
No, that's a public matter. Your
divorces lower our indices.

144
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:47,233
- What do You want from me?
- Wait until the end of the quarter.

145
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:49,944
Then you may divorce as much
as you like.

146
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:54,532
When you're talking, Ivan
Vassilyevich, it looks like a raving.

147
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,243
What do you mean?

148
00:14:57,493 --> 00:15:00,079
And about your suspicious machine.

149
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:03,040
I'm asking you to file an application.

150
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:06,168
Do it, or we'll file a complaint.

151
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:10,881
Wait. Wait! There's nothing
suspicious about my apparatus.

152
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:13,718
I simply invented
a time machine.

153
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:18,097
In other words, I can run through
space and go back to the past.

154
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:20,599
- Go back to the past?
- Yes, to the past.

155
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,852
These experiments, Alexander,

156
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:26,605
can be done only by permission
of the appropriate authorities.

157
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:30,609
Wait, Ivan Vassilyevich.
This apparatus can be very useful.

158
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,403
Let me explain.

159
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,990
That's it!

160
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:09,750
And now we're going to test
the time machine.

161
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,837
You're witnessing
a historic event.

162
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:16,298
First, we'll try a close distance.

163
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:21,137
Look,
we're going to run through space.

164
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:05,389
- Did You see it?
- What?

165
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:07,892
- You see?
- What is it?

166
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:10,728
What happened?

167
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:14,523
Alexander Sergeyevich,
where is the wall?

168
00:18:14,815 --> 00:18:18,319
What is it? What's going on?
There was a wall here!

169
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:23,074
Timofeyev, you will answer for it
in court. Inventing such a machine!

170
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,993
Go to hell
with your wall!

171
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:28,662
- Half a flat has vanished.
- No big deal.

172
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,874
What do you mean, no big deal?

173
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:49,892
I've seen some technical wonders,
but nothing like that.

174
00:18:53,187 --> 00:18:57,441
- Excuse me, and who are you?
- Are you asking who I am?

175
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:00,736
- I'm a friend of Anton Shpak.
- And what are you doing in his flat?

176
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:02,780
What am I doing?

177
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,907
I'm waiting for my friend.

178
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:08,202
And how did you get into his flat
if he's not here?

179
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:11,330
Oh, go to hell!
What kind of questions are those?

180
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:19,505
Never mind. I've gone through time.
I've made it!

181
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:22,842
Tell me, can you lift
any wall like that?

182
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:24,301
A wall?!

183
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:26,554
Your invention is invaluable.

184
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,848
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

185
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,354
Why are you staring at me? There're
no pictures, nor flowers growing on me.

186
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:40,776
You're wearing the same imported
suede jacket as Shpak does.

187
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:43,988
Really?
Ajacket? A suede jacket?

188
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:48,200
Is Shpak the only one in Moscow
who has a suede jacket?

189
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:50,453
What is your name?

190
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:55,458
I'm an artiste of all big and small
academic theatres.

191
00:19:55,708 --> 00:20:00,755
And my name is too famous
to pronounce it.

192
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:04,425
Do you want to get back to Shpak's
room? I can open the wall for you.

193
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:06,719
I'd better take a look at your
machine.

194
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:09,847
- I like it.
- I'm very glad!

195
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:12,349
You're my first witness.

196
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,561
It's my first time
being a witness.

197
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:20,191
Why are you staring? You're going to
rub a hole through me with your eyes.

198
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:23,611
Do you realize
what you have just seen?

199
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,905
You bet! But tell me...

200
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:31,744
Can you lift a wall like that
in a store?

201
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:35,998
- My, what a useful invention!
- You came to Shapk's with a recorder?

202
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,292
Forget the wall.

203
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:42,838
The most important thing is that
through walls I can pierce space.

204
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:48,177
I can enter time.
I can go 200, 300 years back!

205
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,807
You have ignored my question
about the tape recorder.

206
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,059
Darn you!

207
00:20:55,351 --> 00:21:01,148
What a machine! A breakthrough in
science and technology! Darn you again!

208
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:04,693
I can't wait!
Let's go back into the past

209
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:07,279
and see the ancient Moscow!

210
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:11,033
What are you saying, Timofeyev?

211
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:14,495
Before seeing the ancient Moscow,
get a permission from the authorities!

212
00:21:14,745 --> 00:21:16,163
Just a minute!

213
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:21,168
If you mess again with the academic's
tests and stop technological progress...

214
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:24,380
- I'm going to...
- Calm down! Calm down! I got it.

215
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,132
Do it.

216
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:31,387
- I'm so nervous.
- Don't chicken! I'm here!

217
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:22,980
...to the heavenly abode...

218
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:26,484
...to the Reverend Father Superior,
Kuzma...

219
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:28,778
Kuzma...

220
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:32,198
the Tsar and Grand Duke of all Russia...

221
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,785
Of all Russia...

222
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:38,746
is bowing low.

223
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:46,253
Go on writing.

224
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:52,134
Look!
That's Ivan the Terrible!

225
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:54,303
You're kidding!

226
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:03,729
Mamma mia!

227
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:13,155
The demons!
The demons!

228
00:23:14,031 --> 00:23:15,449
The demons!

229
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:20,079
Away!
Stay away!

230
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:26,919
Woe is me, the sinner!
Woe is me, cursed murderer!

231
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:29,130
The evil spirit!

232
00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:33,175
- Wait! Where are you going? Wait!
- Go away, vanish, evil spirit!

233
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:51,694
- Who are You calling?
- The police.

234
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:56,782
- Put down the phone.
- What? What do you mean?

235
00:23:57,032 --> 00:24:00,536
- The phone! Put down the phone!
- Why? I won't!

236
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:03,164
Put down the phone, I say!

237
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:05,416
- Easy! Easy!
- I'll crush you, big hat!

238
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,793
Where are the demons?

239
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:19,805
Get them!

240
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:41,369
Wait! Wait!

241
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,467
They've bricked me up!
They've bricked me up, the demons!

242
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:45,891
That's what the life-giving cross
can do!

243
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:10,041
And where's the tsar?

244
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,629
You shouldn't drink so much.

245
00:26:29,977 --> 00:26:31,937
Where are they?

246
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:35,274
Hurry! Move it!

247
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:53,376
Why are they yelling?

248
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:56,337
They cannot yell.
They're all dead.

249
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:05,388
See how those dead can shoot?

250
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:08,349
- Open up, dog!
- Whom is he addressing?

251
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,602
- You.
- Me?!

252
00:27:42,591 --> 00:27:46,846
Oh, I feel so bad!
Bespeak again, aren't you a demon?

253
00:27:47,096 --> 00:27:49,974
I told you already.
I'm not a demon!

254
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:53,102
Don't dare lying to me!
You're lying to a tsar!

255
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:57,189
Not by human wish, but by God's will,
am I the tsar!

256
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,317
Very well!
I see that you're a tsar...

257
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:04,739
Alas, alas, I'm the tsar
Ivan Vassilyevich!

258
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:08,367
Send me back, magician!

259
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:11,996
I cannot! You see,
because of this pole-axe!

260
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:16,500
Thank you!
The transistors have burned,

261
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:20,171
so I cannot send you back
until I buy the new ones.

262
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:24,967
- Buy them, then.
- The stores are closed for lunch.

263
00:28:25,342 --> 00:28:28,095
Oh, woe is me!

264
00:28:28,345 --> 00:28:32,308
- Take it easy, Ivan Vassilyevich!
- Oh, woe is me!

265
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:37,605
- do You drink vodka?
- Yes, the anise one!

266
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:39,106
Good.

267
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:42,276
Unfortunately, there's no anise vodka.

268
00:28:45,654 --> 00:28:49,492
I say, there's no anise vodka,
only Stolichnaya!

269
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:53,621
Drink it!

270
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,375
- Taste it from My cup.
- Why?

271
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,293
Go on, taste it...

272
00:29:00,294 --> 00:29:03,047
You think I want to poison you?

273
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:06,300
We don't do that any more,

274
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,720
and in our day, you'd sooner get
poisoned with canned food, than vodka.

275
00:29:09,845 --> 00:29:11,180
Don't be afraid, drink up!

276
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:16,394
- Let you be healthy, Boyar!
- Your health!

277
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:24,652
- Was it your housekeeper Who made it?
- Let's suppose so. Eat something!

278
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:37,790
- Who made this machine? You?
- Yes.

279
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:41,877
I had a man like you.
He made wings.

280
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:43,713
- Well?
- What do you mean, well?

281
00:29:43,963 --> 00:29:47,174
I put him on a gun-powder barrel.
It made him fly! Ha-ha!

282
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,802
Why did you do it?

283
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:53,097
No, no. I don't drink. I don't drink,
Ivan Vassilyevich. Thank you.

284
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:55,641
- Don't you have any respect for me?
- For God's sake, Ivan Vassilyevich!

285
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:59,395
- Then drink.
- Just a little. Enough! Enough!

286
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:04,692
- Well, be healthy!
- Your health!

287
00:30:10,823 --> 00:30:13,242
So, you live here?

288
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:17,580
- Well, very cramped quarters.
- Sure, it's not like tsar's chambers.

289
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:21,083
- Yes, that's right.
- Anyway, it's an individual flat.

290
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:24,211
And your woman,
is she at church?

291
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:29,216
My woman eloped today with
her lover, Yakin, to the Caucasus.

292
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:31,886
You are kidding?!
Did you send men to catch them?

293
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:36,891
When they catch them, first thing
have Yakin impaled, and then...

294
00:30:37,224 --> 00:30:40,061
Why?
They're in love with each other.

295
00:30:40,394 --> 00:30:43,481
I wish them every happiness.

296
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:51,030
How kind you are!

297
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:53,824
Oh, God! What's going on?

298
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:57,745
I sit here, while the Swedes
are taking Kem there.

299
00:30:57,995 --> 00:31:01,040
Send me back, Boyar.

300
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,752
Go and buy those transistors.

301
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:06,879
Just a minute.

302
00:31:11,008 --> 00:31:14,553
I'm busy.
Call me later.

303
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:17,306
- I'm going with you.
- Right onto the street?

304
00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:20,267
No, Ivan Vassilyevich,
wait for me here.

305
00:31:20,518 --> 00:31:23,729
Hurry up, though, Boyar!

306
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:27,191
I'm in a hurry myself.
I must rescue those two, as well.

307
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:29,610
What's going to happen to them?

308
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,988
- They'll be beheaded, that's all.
- That's all?

309
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:35,533
To hell with them!

310
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:47,336
Take the demons alive!

311
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,617
Wait!

312
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,145
Eureka!

313
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:54,523
The tsar's garb!

314
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:58,819
Put them on.
You'll be the tsar!

315
00:34:59,278 --> 00:35:00,613
No way!

316
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,366
Put them on, or I'll kill you!

317
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:17,565
Talk to me, my dear guitar,

318
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:20,484
My friend of seven strings.

319
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:24,363
All my heart is open ajar,

320
00:36:25,322 --> 00:36:28,242
And the night with moonlight sings.

321
00:36:28,617 --> 00:36:32,580
Well, once,
then another time,

322
00:36:32,913 --> 00:36:37,043
And again many, many, many times.

323
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:43,299
Yes, once and again, and again
many, many times.

324
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:50,431
Blue cornflowers in the field,
A long path lies ahead.

325
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:58,064
My heart is torn between the guilt
And the stars unread.

326
00:36:58,814 --> 00:37:01,942
Well, once, then another time,

327
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:06,572
And again many, many, many times.

328
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:12,578
Yes, once and again, and again
many, many times.

329
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:17,249
- Well, how do I look?
- Not like him! You're a fake!

330
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:21,379
Let me tie up your teeth at least.
You're a pain in the neck!

331
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:29,637
- the other tsar looks smarter.
- Don't get personal, please!

332
00:37:32,848 --> 00:37:35,851
Sit down!
Occupy yourself with matters of state.

333
00:37:36,102 --> 00:37:37,978
Take the stick.

334
00:37:38,354 --> 00:37:40,523
- Go ahead, dictate.
- Dictate what?

335
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,442
The tsar, repeat it,
of all Russia...

336
00:37:43,692 --> 00:37:45,695
The tsar, repeat it,
of all Russia...

337
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:48,406
Don't repeat "repeat it"!
Quiet!

338
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:56,914
So you say:
"The tsar and Grand Duke..."

339
00:37:58,374 --> 00:38:00,918
I wrote it, comma.

340
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:04,255
Where the hell
is our secretary?

341
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:07,591
What's up, comrades?

342
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:11,345
I'm asking you,
what's up?

343
00:38:17,601 --> 00:38:23,107
Who's that parasite who dared to
break the door in the tsar's quarters?

344
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:26,861
Did they put it here
for you to break it?

345
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:36,037
Go on, Your Majesty!
"...is bowing low...", semicolon.

346
00:38:38,205 --> 00:38:41,208
I'm waiting for the answer
to my question!

347
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:46,422
The tsar! The tsar's here!
He's here!

348
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:49,592
The tsar's here!

349
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:51,635
Sit!

350
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:54,972
Where else can he be?
The tsar's in his place!

351
00:38:55,598 --> 00:38:58,184
Have mercy, don't put me to death,
our kind sire!

352
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,313
The demons grabbed you,
we chased them all over the palace!

353
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:05,941
And, suddenly, the demons vanished!

354
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:10,154
They were there, we don't deny it.
But they self-destructed.

355
00:39:10,488 --> 00:39:14,075
Please, stop this ridiculous panic!
Who are you?

356
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:19,121
I'm Theophanes, a clerk
at the foreign office.

357
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,874
All right, Fedya.
You may stay here.

358
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:26,545
The rest, please, leave the tsar's
office. In other words, out!

359
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:29,548
Bark at them!

360
00:39:29,882 --> 00:39:31,592
Out!

361
00:39:37,973 --> 00:39:39,975
Have mercy, Sire!

362
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:43,521
Stop your somersaults! You did it
once, you did it twice. It's enough.

363
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:47,983
What's the matter with you, Sire?

364
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:53,489
Have you taken ill?

365
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:58,411
Don't sit like a dummy!
I can't work here all alone!

366
00:39:59,453 --> 00:40:01,163
I've got a toothache.

367
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:03,624
He's got periostitis, a gumboil.

368
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,377
- And you stop pestering the tsar!
- Yes, sir.

369
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:10,214
Fedya, enough of your bowing! Are
you going to fall like that all night?

370
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:16,095
- Nice to meet You.
- Don't be angry, Boyar...

371
00:40:16,387 --> 00:40:19,640
but I don't recognize you.
Are you a prince?

372
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:23,477
Me? Well, I might be.
What so strange about it?

373
00:40:25,229 --> 00:40:28,858
How do you happen to be in the tsar's
quarters? You weren't here before.

374
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,447
- Oh, Sire, who is he?
- He's a friend of Anton Shpak's.

375
00:40:34,947 --> 00:40:36,574
What a fool!

376
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:42,997
The tsar says that I'm Prince
Miloslavsky. Are you satisfied?

377
00:40:43,998 --> 00:40:47,376
- Oh my! Stay away!
- What's the matter? What is it?

378
00:40:47,626 --> 00:40:51,422
- You've been executed!
- That's news to me!

379
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:57,928
By the tsar's order, you were hanged
on your own gate three days ago.

380
00:41:04,852 --> 00:41:08,314
Well, thanks!
I was hanged by your order.

381
00:41:08,773 --> 00:41:11,233
Help me out, or we'll screw it.

382
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,028
Why don't you say something, bastard?

383
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:18,032
Oh, now I remember!
It was not I who was hanged.

384
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:20,743
What was his first name, the one
whom they hanged?

385
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:24,372
- Vanka the Robber.
- You see? And I'm George.

386
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:28,125
That bandit was just my namesake.
Am I right?

387
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:30,586
Am I right?

388
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:32,546
Please...

389
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:37,802
Why are they shouting there?
Fedya, go and find out.

390
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:39,303
Yes, sir.

391
00:41:41,263 --> 00:41:45,518
The tsar!
The tsar!

392
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:50,481
Go! Go! Score! Score!

393
00:41:50,815 --> 00:41:55,069
The common people wish to see their
tsar who was saved. They're rejoicing.

394
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:57,405
Oh, no, it's out of the question.

395
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,700
We have no time for that.
We'll rejoice later.

396
00:42:04,453 --> 00:42:07,164
They have to be sent away at once,
understand?

397
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:11,210
Still wouldn't say anything, damn him!

398
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:17,800
- Fedya, I hope there's no war going?
- Of course, there is, my benefactor.

399
00:42:18,092 --> 00:42:22,096
The Swedes are biting us, the Khan of
Crimea plays nasty on Izyum Road.

400
00:42:22,346 --> 00:42:24,056
- You don't say!
- Yes.

401
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:27,226
- Why do You Let them?
- Have mercy, Sire!

402
00:42:31,147 --> 00:42:32,857
Get up, Fyodor.

403
00:42:34,066 --> 00:42:36,402
I don't blame you...
Sit down.

404
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:39,989
Write down the tsar's edict.

405
00:42:40,322 --> 00:42:43,492
I order
to send an army

406
00:42:43,951 --> 00:42:49,123
to Izyum Road
and rout the Khan of Crimea.

407
00:42:49,874 --> 00:42:52,585
- Period.
- Period.

408
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,342
Sign it, our great tsar.

409
00:43:00,718 --> 00:43:04,180
I have no right to sign
historic documents.

410
00:43:10,144 --> 00:43:12,688
No, I have no right to sign...

411
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:24,992
Acting for the tsar, I. Bunsha.

412
00:43:26,243 --> 00:43:27,578
Here, Fedya.

413
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,539
And tell them
not to hurry back.

414
00:43:30,748 --> 00:43:34,168
Tell them to capture Kazan on their
way back, not to go there twice.

415
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:39,465
How come? Kazan is ours.
We've taken it long ago.

416
00:43:39,632 --> 00:43:40,966
- Really?
- Sure.

417
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:44,220
You were too hasty to do it.
All right, all right, then.

418
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,182
Since it's already taken, let it be.
Why give it back?

419
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:55,856
Well, go!

420
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:00,903
And in five minutes I don't want to
see either hide or hair of them here!

421
00:44:02,905 --> 00:44:08,119
Mount your horses!

422
00:44:09,078 --> 00:44:10,454
Start a song!

423
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:22,383
Early in the spring,
By a fir-tree all green,

424
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:26,178
Vanyusha's bidding farewell to his
love.

425
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:30,099
Clad in a shirt of mail,
He's saying to his gal:

426
00:44:30,516 --> 00:44:34,145
"Don't cry, Marusya, don't cry,
my dove."

427
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:38,065
Marusya says nothing, only weeps,

428
00:44:38,357 --> 00:44:39,859
Her sorrow

429
00:44:40,151 --> 00:44:42,528
Holds her heart in grips.

430
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:47,783
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

431
00:44:48,075 --> 00:44:50,786
Drop the tears right onto his spear.

432
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,749
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

433
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:58,753
Drop a sea of tears,

434
00:44:59,003 --> 00:45:01,422
Drop-drop-drop
Right onto his spear.

435
00:45:05,342 --> 00:45:08,512
In winter, cold 'n' severe,
Again under the fir-tree,

436
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:12,892
Vanyusha's being greeted by his love.

437
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:16,771
Clad in a shirt of mail,
He's saying to his gal:

438
00:45:17,104 --> 00:45:20,483
"I've come to you, I'm back, my dove."

439
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:24,653
Marusya is so happy, she weeps,

440
00:45:24,987 --> 00:45:28,532
Like a psaltery,
Herjoyful heartjust sweeps.

441
00:45:29,533 --> 00:45:33,245
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

442
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:36,374
Drop the tears right onto his spear.

443
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,128
Drop, drop, drop! Marusya's eyes,
so dear,

444
00:45:41,587 --> 00:45:43,923
drop so sweet a tear...

445
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,674
Drop, drop

446
00:45:46,008 --> 00:45:48,260
Right onto his spear.

447
00:45:57,144 --> 00:45:59,146
Drop, drop, drop!

448
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:08,489
Marusya is so happy, she weeps

449
00:46:08,781 --> 00:46:12,868
Like a psaltery,
Herjoyful heartjust sweeps.

450
00:46:13,285 --> 00:46:15,496
Well, we got things going!

451
00:46:16,163 --> 00:46:19,375
Why doesn't the inventor turn
his time machine back?

452
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:23,295
- What a scandal awaits me at home!
- Why?

453
00:46:23,587 --> 00:46:27,675
- I didn't tell Ulyuana where I went.
- Oh, yes, of course.

454
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,596
We couldn't care less,
We couldn't care less,

455
00:46:32,847 --> 00:46:36,392
Though owls and wolves
Make us real wuss...

456
00:46:37,643 --> 00:46:42,481
Alexander Sergeyevich! I'm sorry
to bother you during a family crisis.

457
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:46,944
Did Ivan Vassilyevich drop by?
They're looking for him everywhere.

458
00:46:47,987 --> 00:46:51,282
We couldn't care less...
We firmly believe...

459
00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:02,543
CLOSED FOR INVENTORY

460
00:47:11,177 --> 00:47:14,305
CLOSED FOR REDECORATION

461
00:47:55,304 --> 00:47:57,306
What a scoundrel!

462
00:47:58,891 --> 00:48:03,604
I shouldn't have confessed
to this saintly man!

463
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:08,901
Shurik, are you home?

464
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:12,488
Shurik!

465
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:24,417
Shurik!

466
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:45,229
What is that?

467
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:53,154
Oh, I've taken the bag of that
bastard, Yakin.

468
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:54,947
FILM STUDIO

469
00:48:58,242 --> 00:49:01,787
First, this hysterical woman
made a scene on the set,

470
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:07,918
and then she mixed up our suitcases.
All this just an hour before our plane!

471
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:12,131
Karp Savelyevich!
I can't believe how lucky I am.

472
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:26,187
Wait for me and I'll be back.

473
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:39,950
Hello? Anyuta, you won't believe it!

474
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:43,287
I'm flying to Gagry
with Yakin.

475
00:49:44,163 --> 00:49:47,416
Zinaida Mikhailovna, I think
you realize

476
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:51,837
that it's all over between us
after what you've done at the studio.

477
00:49:52,088 --> 00:49:54,965
Karp Savelyevich,
you're a scoundrel!

478
00:49:55,216 --> 00:49:58,469
Please, return my bag, and here's
yours.

479
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:02,556
- I hope that all My things are in it?
- What?

480
00:50:05,851 --> 00:50:08,521
Oh, you bastard! You jerk!

481
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:13,734
I left my husband, that saintly man
with all the accommodations,

482
00:50:14,193 --> 00:50:16,320
a genius, an inventor,

483
00:50:16,654 --> 00:50:18,864
for this scoundrel...

484
00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:22,076
My goodness, such brilliant lines!

485
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:24,704
You haven't heard real lines yet!

486
00:50:25,204 --> 00:50:27,373
And two hours before our leaving,

487
00:50:27,665 --> 00:50:31,210
I find him with some witch,

488
00:50:31,544 --> 00:50:34,839
whom he's holding by her hand,

489
00:50:35,297 --> 00:50:40,219
and behaving
like a two-bitjerk.

490
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,513
We were rehearsing a scene.

491
00:50:42,972 --> 00:50:47,101
This is my professional duty.
Profession de foi.

492
00:50:47,393 --> 00:50:49,729
Enough! I'm fed up!

493
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,690
I'm leaving you

494
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,194
for director Budimir Kosoy
and his production of "Boris Godunov".

495
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:59,989
Kosoy is a fake.

496
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:04,660
And you're a failure!
For him, I'm going to play a tsarina.

497
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:08,456
Kosoy hasn't yet found anyone
for the part of Ivan the Terrible.

498
00:51:08,748 --> 00:51:11,292
What?
No Ivan the Terrible?

499
00:51:12,585 --> 00:51:15,755
- But I've already rehearsed with him!
- Where?

500
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:19,425
Here!
Right in this room!

501
00:51:19,717 --> 00:51:22,511
And who's playing Tsar Boris?
Who?

502
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:25,473
What Tsar Boris?

503
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:29,643
- Boriska?
- What is it?

504
00:51:29,935 --> 00:51:33,731
- Boriska is to become a tsar?
- What? Are you really rehearsing?

505
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:38,486
That's how he, sly fox, is paying
for the good I've done him?

506
00:51:38,903 --> 00:51:42,281
He wants to be a tsar
and take all tsardom in his hand!

507
00:51:42,531 --> 00:51:44,992
Death, that's what he deserves!

508
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:49,872
Oh, my God, what a character!
Bravo! Bravo!

509
00:51:51,415 --> 00:51:53,209
Please, go on!

510
00:51:54,335 --> 00:51:57,630
Why did you hurt this Boyar woman,
you lowly man?

511
00:51:57,922 --> 00:52:01,884
It's great! It's amazing!
He's a genius!

512
00:52:02,134 --> 00:52:05,930
Listen, I can't recognize you in your
makeup. Who are you?

513
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,933
Sergey Bondarchuk?
No.

514
00:52:09,975 --> 00:52:13,020
Oh, you're Yuri Nikulin!
No, no, no.

515
00:52:16,482 --> 00:52:18,150
Oh, my God!

516
00:52:19,985 --> 00:52:22,905
Innokenty Smoktunovsky!

517
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:25,741
Kesha!

518
00:52:29,036 --> 00:52:31,038
Why didn't you tell me?

519
00:52:31,288 --> 00:52:35,626
- You vagabond, you vile shrimp!
- Are you crazy?

520
00:52:37,211 --> 00:52:39,171
There, get it,
son of a bitch!

521
00:52:40,673 --> 00:52:42,591
Oh, my God!

522
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:46,512
You scoundrel! Son of a bitch!
Damned adulterer!

523
00:52:46,804 --> 00:52:49,098
He is a real tsar!

524
00:52:50,891 --> 00:52:54,395
Help! Somebody! Call the police!

525
00:52:55,229 --> 00:52:58,024
On your knees, you worm!

526
00:52:58,566 --> 00:53:01,819
I've caught you, Yakin! Adulterer
and son of a bitch!

527
00:53:02,153 --> 00:53:06,741
Pray, son of a bitch!
This is your last prayer!

528
00:53:07,283 --> 00:53:11,537
- Oh, you're rehearsing?
- Yes, we're rehearsing.

529
00:53:13,414 --> 00:53:16,917
What do you mean, rehearsing?
Call the police!

530
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:20,463
- Where are You going?
- I'm here. I'm here.

531
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:23,007
You act very well!

532
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:26,427
And the tsar looks very authentic...

533
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,431
He looks just like Bunsha.

534
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:37,438
I've been robbed, Zinaida Mikhailovna.
I'm waiting for the police with dogs.

535
00:53:38,064 --> 00:53:39,899
Who do you belong to?

536
00:53:40,358 --> 00:53:44,236
Excuse me, comrade actor,
but what do you mean, "belong"?

537
00:53:44,528 --> 00:53:47,365
- Whose serf are You?
- Sorry, but I don't understand you.

538
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:50,701
A very stupid serf!

539
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:54,580
Excuse me, but why do you keep
calling me a serf?

540
00:53:54,872 --> 00:53:57,958
- Where Did You get that word?
- It's from the part he's playing.

541
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,504
That part is denigrating!
Please, don't apply it to me!

542
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:05,758
Oh, God! Some apartment house!
They rob you, they call you names!

543
00:54:06,008 --> 00:54:09,136
We'll never win the honorary title of
a house of cultured communal living.

544
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:11,931
This is an outrage! An outrage!

545
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,727
Well, lascivious shrimp, beg the Boyar
woman if she giveth you life or death!

546
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:20,272
- Life.
- Life. Life.

547
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,525
Be merciful, O great tsar!

548
00:54:22,942 --> 00:54:24,276
Life?

549
00:54:26,278 --> 00:54:29,407
Be it your way.

550
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:38,874
Listen to me, Karp,
but, please, don't get excited.

551
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:42,294
This is the real Ivan the Terrible!

552
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:47,800
Do you remember I was telling you
about the time machine?

553
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:51,512
Well, Shurik did succeed with
that experiment!

554
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:02,898
- But he could have killed me!
- And would have done good!

555
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:05,901
It's crazy!

556
00:55:06,694 --> 00:55:11,198
What do you mean, Ivan the Terrible?
He's been long dead!

557
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,410
- Who's dead?
- I didn't mean you.

558
00:55:14,827 --> 00:55:17,621
I mean the other one,
the one who's been dead...

559
00:55:27,423 --> 00:55:29,884
- Did You seduce the Boyar woman?
- Yes, I did.

560
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:35,097
I am he... that liveth...

561
00:55:35,681 --> 00:55:40,352
What do you mean, you liveth,
vile dog? Look at yourself!

562
00:55:40,478 --> 00:55:41,812
Liveth!

563
00:55:41,937 --> 00:55:45,441
- Help me. Say something in Slavonic.
- Thy!

564
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:49,737
Thy... thy cherub.

565
00:55:50,279 --> 00:55:52,615
Your Excellency, have mercy!

566
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:55,451
You have misunderstood me.

567
00:55:56,952 --> 00:55:59,288
How can I understand you,
if you don't say anything?

568
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:02,583
I don't know foreign languages,
your highness.

569
00:56:04,043 --> 00:56:07,254
- do You love this Boyar woman?
- I'm crazy about her!

570
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:12,676
Look at her! Beauteous to behold,

571
00:56:12,927 --> 00:56:16,764
crimson in her lips, crescents in her
brows!

572
00:56:17,681 --> 00:56:20,601
- What more do you want, dog?
- Nothing!

573
00:56:20,851 --> 00:56:23,896
Then marry her, fool!
The prince is letting her go.

574
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:26,607
I'm asking for your hand,
Zinaida Mikhailovna!

575
00:56:29,068 --> 00:56:33,447
Hello? Galya? You're going to fall
down! I've got great news!

576
00:56:33,698 --> 00:56:36,242
Yakin has left his witch,

577
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:38,619
and we're going to Gagry.

578
00:56:39,036 --> 00:56:43,708
Well, you sinning beard! Should I
hear that you've done something...

579
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:46,335
- I swear!
- Don't interrupt the tsar!

580
00:56:46,585 --> 00:56:50,673
- Yes, Sire!
- I'm giving you one of my coats.

581
00:56:51,632 --> 00:56:56,887
- Thank him! Thank him!
- Thou art... I thank thee humbly!

582
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,392
Sire!

583
00:57:01,642 --> 00:57:03,894
You can't stay here
looking like this!

584
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:08,024
People might think I don't know what.

585
00:57:08,399 --> 00:57:13,738
Oh, God Almighty!
I forgot where I am, O Lord!

586
00:57:14,113 --> 00:57:15,448
I've forgotten everything!

587
00:57:15,573 --> 00:57:19,493
You must change your clothes,
Ivan Vassilyevich!

588
00:57:20,578 --> 00:57:24,707
Oh, the demons' garb!
A temptation...

589
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:31,589
My mind is all confused.
The coat, the Tsar Ivan the Terrible...

590
00:57:31,922 --> 00:57:36,469
Stop being so fidgety! Well, it is
Ivan the Terrible. So what? Big deal!

591
00:57:36,802 --> 00:57:39,180
You had better go
and help the tsar change.

592
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:40,639
Yes, ma'am.

593
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:45,728
Hello? Vava?
You'll never believe it!

594
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,814
Oh, my God!

595
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,280
He looks so much like our Bunsha!

596
00:57:58,616 --> 00:58:01,160
- Pah!
- It looks very good on you.

597
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:04,705
- Dear Tsar, we must go.
- Perchance... we shalt...

598
00:58:05,164 --> 00:58:07,917
We have a plane to catch.

599
00:58:09,168 --> 00:58:11,045
Godspeed!

600
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:13,589
May we thank you for everything?

601
00:58:14,256 --> 00:58:19,261
You're a very spirited man!

602
00:58:40,616 --> 00:58:41,951
Hello? Shurochka?

603
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:45,121
Can you imagine? Yakin
fell for me like a silly boy.

604
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:50,918
He proposed, and we're leaving
for our honeymoon. Many kisses.

605
00:58:51,919 --> 00:58:53,254
Go!

606
00:59:00,261 --> 00:59:04,682
Oh, how beautiful it is!
Beauteous!

607
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:17,528
Beauteous!

608
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,115
Cigarette break!

609
00:59:27,038 --> 00:59:30,082
- The Swedish Ambassador!
- What's up, Fedya?

610
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:36,088
The Swedish ambassador
asks for an audience.

611
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:12,291
Bring the ambassador in.

612
01:00:15,169 --> 01:00:19,048
Knit your brows! Knit your brows!

613
01:00:56,043 --> 01:00:58,337
Der grosse Konig,

614
01:00:58,754 --> 01:01:03,676
Des Schwedischen Konigreichs sende
mich,

615
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,513
seinen treuen Diener,

616
01:01:07,972 --> 01:01:13,436
zu Ihnen, Czar and Grande Duc

617
01:01:14,228 --> 01:01:16,355
Ivan Vassilyevich...

618
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:20,359
usarussa.

619
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:24,030
- This foreign tourist speaks well!
- What exactly does he say?

620
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,741
I'll be damned if I know.
Fedya!

621
01:01:28,743 --> 01:01:31,704
- We need an interpreter.
- We had one. He was German.

622
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,373
He got drunk as a lord
when he had to translate.

623
01:01:34,749 --> 01:01:38,127
- So We cooked him in boiled water.
- It's not the way to treat interpreters.

624
01:01:38,669 --> 01:01:41,589
Schwedete armie erobern hut.

625
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:45,092
Answer something.
See, the man goes out of his way.

626
01:01:45,718 --> 01:01:47,762
Hitler kaput!

627
01:01:48,262 --> 01:01:51,766
Go on, Mister Ambassador.
We absolutely agree with you.

628
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:56,020
- Kemska district.
- Right. Absolutely.

629
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,025
Absolutely.

630
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:06,447
Look, comrade.
Excuse us for a minute.

631
01:02:07,406 --> 01:02:11,744
I would like to know
what he wants, in general terms.

632
01:02:12,536 --> 01:02:14,747
It's very simple.

633
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:19,043
They want Kemsk Region. They went to
war, so, they say, give it to us.

634
01:02:19,293 --> 01:02:21,754
What? Kemsk Region?

635
01:02:22,296 --> 01:02:25,925
Ja, Kemska rejion. Ja, ja...

636
01:02:26,884 --> 01:02:29,887
Take it if you want it! Oh, God!
I thought it was something important.

637
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:33,641
- But you can't do it, benefactor.
- The tsar knows what he's doing.

638
01:02:34,225 --> 01:02:38,062
Our state won't be any poorer for it.
Take it! Take it!

639
01:02:38,771 --> 01:02:42,900
Have mercy, our great tsar,
and allow me to speak.

640
01:02:46,278 --> 01:02:50,282
What are you doing, son of a bitch?
Some impostor squandering our lands!

641
01:02:50,616 --> 01:02:52,743
We shall never have enough regions
for you!

642
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,454
So whadda I say my king?

643
01:02:58,124 --> 01:03:00,918
Say your king
my warm greetings.

644
01:03:01,419 --> 01:03:03,462
Whadda about Kemsk region?

645
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:07,466
Such questions, my dear ambassador,
are not decided at the drop of a hat.

646
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,637
We have to consult with comrades.
Come back in a few days.

647
01:03:11,929 --> 01:03:15,808
Yes, by the way, here's a little
souvenir for you from me.

648
01:03:19,603 --> 01:03:20,980
Here!

649
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:34,744
Well, auf Wiedersehen!
Goodbye! Au revoir! In short, ciao!

650
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:43,711
Everyone can go!

651
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:49,091
The guards can go, too.

652
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,011
The guards can go.

653
01:04:03,314 --> 01:04:05,399
Why are you crawling, old chap?

654
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,778
The ambassador has lost his chest
decoration.

655
01:04:09,987 --> 01:04:14,992
He shouldn't be so absent-minded. One
should watch his things when in a room.

656
01:04:16,952 --> 01:04:19,372
Why are you staring at me?

657
01:04:19,663 --> 01:04:22,708
- do You think I took it?
- No, of course not!

658
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,127
You didn't take it, did you?

659
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:29,340
Maybe it has slid under the throne?

660
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:31,967
No.

661
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:34,845
Well, then nothing can be done.

662
01:04:35,096 --> 01:04:36,764
What a misfortune!

663
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:47,733
I am again tormented by some
troubling doubts.

664
01:04:48,025 --> 01:04:51,862
Shpak's tape recorder,
the ambassador's medal...

665
01:04:52,113 --> 01:04:54,031
What are you driving at?

666
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:57,868
I'm asking you, you tsar's mug,
what are you hinting at?

667
01:04:58,202 --> 01:05:02,081
The Tartar Prince Yedigey is here
to see the tsar.

668
01:05:02,373 --> 01:05:05,042
No.
That's too much.

669
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:10,172
Calling hours are over.
We have a lunch break.

670
01:05:12,216 --> 01:05:15,136
The tsar wishes to refect.

671
01:05:30,776 --> 01:05:33,362
- I must be dreaming!
- Just a minute.

672
01:05:33,612 --> 01:05:37,950
- Who's going to pay for this banquet?
- In any case, not us.

673
01:05:38,325 --> 01:05:40,077
Fedya, what is in there?

674
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:43,497
Hare's kidneys,

675
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:47,793
pike heads with garlic.
Black caviar.

676
01:05:48,419 --> 01:05:49,754
Red caviar.

677
01:05:49,962 --> 01:05:53,007
And from overseas...

678
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,386
Eggplant caviar!

679
01:05:58,763 --> 01:06:00,181
Beautiful!

680
01:06:00,473 --> 01:06:04,268
- Well, tsar, let's drink.
- Let's drink.

681
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:34,423
Beauteous!

682
01:06:34,548 --> 01:06:38,052
I look for him all over the house, and
here's he, in someone else's flat.

683
01:06:38,302 --> 01:06:40,304
Why don't you look me in the eye?

684
01:06:40,554 --> 01:06:42,932
Ivan Vassilyevich,
I've been burglarized!

685
01:06:43,474 --> 01:06:47,895
Everything I've got by working
tirelessly, everything is gone!

686
01:06:48,229 --> 01:06:51,440
Oh, look at you!
You're blind drunk!

687
01:06:51,691 --> 01:06:55,111
You don't look like yourself!
What on earth did you put on yourself?

688
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:59,532
- Imported tape recorder, suede jacket...
- He's drunk!

689
01:06:59,824 --> 01:07:01,367
There's nothing left!

690
01:07:02,076 --> 01:07:04,829
He can't stand on his feet!
Where are you going?

691
01:07:06,247 --> 01:07:09,917
Oh, God! What's going on?
Go home now, alcoholic!

692
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:13,212
Leave me alone, old woman,
I'm being sad.

693
01:07:13,921 --> 01:07:17,007
Old woman? You jerk!

694
01:07:17,341 --> 01:07:19,343
I'm five years younger than you!

695
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:22,012
Let's go home, now!

696
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:24,682
You are a witch!

697
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:27,268
Help!

698
01:07:27,768 --> 01:07:30,980
Ivan Vassilyevich, calm down.

699
01:07:34,358 --> 01:07:37,319
- Witch!
- To be absolutely honest, yes.

700
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:42,033
- And What do You want?
- Dear Ivan Vassilyevich,

701
01:07:42,283 --> 01:07:44,952
that's the list of stolen things.

702
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:50,499
Two tape recorders, two movie cameras,
two cigarette cases. Please!

703
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:53,711
Is it the way to hand in a petition
to the tsar?

704
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:57,381
What do you mean? Stop your
hooliganism!

705
01:07:58,716 --> 01:08:04,180
You and your drunken tricks! I'll file
a collective complaint against you!

706
01:08:04,472 --> 01:08:07,516
I see you never stop, lackey!

707
01:08:09,226 --> 01:08:12,438
Hello? Is that a psychiatric ward?

708
01:08:12,938 --> 01:08:18,069
My husband has got a delirium tremens.
He attacks people with a knife.

709
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:23,074
- Stop! Take the knife away!
- The knife!

710
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:27,203
Just look at our activist!
He's an armed bandit!

711
01:08:27,661 --> 01:08:30,039
- Lowly trash!
- You're trash yourself!

712
01:08:30,373 --> 01:08:31,707
Lackey!

713
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:34,418
The police will decide who's a lackey
here!

714
01:08:35,252 --> 01:08:36,587
Is it the police?

715
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,925
- Wait! He's not Bunsha!
- What do you mean, not Bunsha?

716
01:08:41,175 --> 01:08:44,595
He's Ivan the Terrible. The real one.

717
01:08:57,525 --> 01:08:59,985
I'm busy. Call me later.

718
01:09:00,611 --> 01:09:04,240
- Oh, my God! What's going on?
- I revealed a big secret to you.

719
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:07,159
I beg you to promise that you won't
tell anybody.

720
01:09:07,451 --> 01:09:10,621
Of course! You have my word.

721
01:09:10,871 --> 01:09:14,667
- Thank You.
- Don't mention it.

722
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:21,340
Hello? The police?

723
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:25,136
That's Shpak speaking, who's been
burglarized.

724
01:09:25,428 --> 01:09:28,723
No, it's not about the robbery.
We've got something more weird here.

725
01:09:28,973 --> 01:09:33,060
Engineer Timofeyev has a live
tsar in his apartment.

726
01:09:34,145 --> 01:09:38,357
No, I don't drink.
With a dagger, cold steel...

727
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:42,194
I'm giving you my word of honor!

728
01:09:43,029 --> 01:09:44,363
I'll be waiting.

729
01:09:51,579 --> 01:09:55,041
I can imagine how they fight now
on Izyum Road.

730
01:09:55,374 --> 01:10:00,463
Fedya, what are you doing there, by
the kidneys? Come here, don't be shy.

731
01:10:00,713 --> 01:10:04,216
Here!
Let's drink to friendship!

732
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:10,181
Listen, old chap, do they accept
jewelry at your pawn shop?

733
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,311
- We can arrange it.
- Let's drink.

734
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:19,982
The tsarina is here, Sire.
She wants to see you.

735
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:28,407
Fedya, go back to the kidneys! It was a
bad move. You don't look like a tsar.

736
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:33,120
What? Whoa! Whoa!
Who are you talking to, lackey?

737
01:10:39,377 --> 01:10:44,382
Dear tsarina! I'm so glad!
Nice meeting you! My pleasure.

738
01:10:44,715 --> 01:10:48,886
Hello, I'm the tsar. Nice to meet you.
How do you do, I'm the tsar...

739
01:10:49,136 --> 01:10:53,265
Very pleased, I'm the tsar. Nice to
meet you, I'm the tsar. Very pleased.

740
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:59,605
Please, come to our table.

741
01:11:00,731 --> 01:11:04,402
This way, please.
Please...

742
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,363
Haven't we met before?

743
01:11:07,613 --> 01:11:10,074
- What are you saying, shit?
- Whoa! Whoa!

744
01:11:10,324 --> 01:11:14,370
Hey! Waiter!
One order of kidneys for the tsarina.

745
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,872
Excuse me for a minute.

746
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:22,378
- Sorry, your name, please?
- Why, I'm Marfa Vassilyevna.

747
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:26,048
Wonderful! Enchanting!

748
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:30,261
Marfa Vassilyevna, how enchanting!
A glass of cardamom vodka?

749
01:11:30,553 --> 01:11:33,347
- Oh, no!
- Why? Please, don't refuse.

750
01:11:33,973 --> 01:11:35,975
Your health!

751
01:11:39,687 --> 01:11:42,940
Well, everyone keeps saying: tsar,
tsar...

752
01:11:43,566 --> 01:11:46,485
You think, Marfa Vassilyevna,
it's easy to be a tsar?

753
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:49,238
No, on the contrary!

754
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:53,826
Every working man has two days off,
and we, the tsars, have no days off.

755
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,912
And our working hours are not fixed.

756
01:11:57,705 --> 01:12:02,334
Please, eat, Margarita Vassilyevna.
Everything has been paid for.

757
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:08,632
You know, a tsar's job is so unhealthy
that we should be given free milk.

758
01:12:08,966 --> 01:12:11,385
They wrote it in the Health Magazine

759
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:14,597
that the nervous cells are never
restored.

760
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:19,101
You work and work, our great tsar,
just like a bee!

761
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:25,399
Margo, you alone understand me!

762
01:12:27,651 --> 01:12:32,114
- One more glass to Go with a pike head?
- Oh, no! No!

763
01:12:34,367 --> 01:12:37,828
Tell me, please, do you have
private rooms here?

764
01:12:38,245 --> 01:12:40,915
- I see you're dead drunk!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

765
01:12:41,165 --> 01:12:44,919
Why don't you play, maestro?
Strike up a song!

766
01:12:48,547 --> 01:12:55,513
That's not a big black cloud coming...

767
01:12:57,014 --> 01:12:58,349
A cloud!

768
01:13:00,184 --> 01:13:05,189
That's not a thunderstorm striking...

769
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:10,152
A thunderstorm!

770
01:13:11,737 --> 01:13:18,577
That's the tsar of Crimea, a vile dog...

771
01:13:21,622 --> 01:13:22,957
A dog!

772
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:31,841
What do you mean, a dog?

773
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:35,302
How dare you sing such songs
about a tsar?

774
01:13:35,928 --> 01:13:39,598
You got out of hand here, without me.
What kind of a repertoire is that?

775
01:13:40,474 --> 01:13:44,353
You ought to sing songs for the masses,
something contemporary.

776
01:13:44,603 --> 01:13:48,065
Like... how does it go?
Trali-vali, tili-tili.

777
01:13:48,315 --> 01:13:52,028
We're not the tili-tili,
we're not the trali-vali.

778
01:13:52,278 --> 01:13:54,655
Cool it, Vanya. We'll do everything.

779
01:13:55,781 --> 01:13:58,451
Excuse me, what's your name again?

780
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:01,412
- I'm Marfa Vassilyevna!
- Yes, of course, Marfa.

781
01:14:02,413 --> 01:14:05,458
Oh, Marfusha! The night is still young!

782
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,669
Give us a line,
and we'll pick it up.

783
01:14:08,919 --> 01:14:10,796
Wait! Quiet!

784
01:14:11,297 --> 01:14:13,299
All of a sudden,

785
01:14:15,718 --> 01:14:17,053
Out of the blue,

786
01:14:18,471 --> 01:14:21,432
Love knocked down

787
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:24,060
Upon my door.

788
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:30,649
Is that it? Is that you?
I couldn't hope for anything more.

789
01:14:31,442 --> 01:14:34,862
Snow was falling, dawn after dawn,

790
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:37,948
Days were rainy and mean.

791
01:14:38,491 --> 01:14:41,827
So many years, why were you gone?

792
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:46,874
Where have you ever been?

793
01:14:49,126 --> 01:14:53,547
Like in a dream, the doorjust creaked,

794
01:14:54,131 --> 01:14:57,676
And suddenly, all made sense.

795
01:14:57,968 --> 01:15:00,846
Fate played tricks. Fate intrigued.

796
01:15:01,222 --> 01:15:03,683
And here's our meeting, hence.

797
01:15:04,058 --> 01:15:06,477
I froze at sea, traveled by train.

798
01:15:06,727 --> 01:15:09,021
I know it was not in vain.

799
01:15:09,397 --> 01:15:14,568
No, it was not in vain,
It was not for nothing.

800
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:20,950
All has happened, all came true.
Nobody knows, how.

801
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:27,331
How could I live all this through?
It's just incredible! Wow!

802
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:33,170
If you wait and take it in,
whatever ever lies in store...

803
01:15:33,754 --> 01:15:36,882
Then you can get it, what you dreamed
for,

804
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:40,553
And go hope for more.

805
01:15:41,011 --> 01:15:42,680
Everybody dance!

806
01:15:43,139 --> 01:15:47,518
Like in a dream, the doorjust creaked,

807
01:15:47,852 --> 01:15:51,313
And, suddenly, all made sense.

808
01:15:51,605 --> 01:15:54,525
Fate played tricks. Fate intrigued.

809
01:15:54,775 --> 01:15:57,069
And here's our meeting, hence.

810
01:15:57,445 --> 01:15:59,905
I froze at sea, traveled by train.

811
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:02,616
I know it was not in vain.

812
01:16:02,867 --> 01:16:07,788
No, it was not in vain,
It was not for nothing.

813
01:17:24,532 --> 01:17:29,787
A mutiny in the army!
They say that the tsar's not real!

814
01:17:40,673 --> 01:17:43,509
My dear autocrat, we're done in!

815
01:17:44,468 --> 01:17:47,346
I demand that the banquet go on!

816
01:17:50,016 --> 01:17:52,476
Why are we done in? Why?

817
01:18:27,887 --> 01:18:29,221
This way!

818
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:37,521
Come on, Prince, hurry up!
Send me back!

819
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:40,858
Everything will be ready in 3 minutes.

820
01:19:02,797 --> 01:19:06,926
Wait a bit, Ivan Vassilyevich. You'd
better change into your tsar's clothes.

821
01:19:07,385 --> 01:19:08,886
Damn!

822
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:31,367
Do you smoke?

823
01:19:33,994 --> 01:19:36,706
You don't? Good.
I don't smoke either.

824
01:19:37,164 --> 01:19:39,750
So tell me, who are you?

825
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,920
- I am the tsar.
- Nickname?

826
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:47,466
- Wait. your name?
- We're the Ryuriks.

827
01:19:47,925 --> 01:19:51,429
- First, second name?
- Ivan Vassilyevich.

828
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:53,639
Ivan...

829
01:19:54,181 --> 01:19:59,770
- Date of birth?
- 1533 A.D.

830
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,692
- Joking?
- Very funny.

831
01:20:04,984 --> 01:20:09,030
- Wait. Residence?
- My palace.

832
01:20:10,322 --> 01:20:13,993
What palace?
The address?

833
01:20:14,618 --> 01:20:18,581
- What am I accused of, Boyar?
- You'll meet your boyars in the can!

834
01:20:19,123 --> 01:20:22,376
- Was it you who busted Shpak's place?
- Shpak's?

835
01:20:23,127 --> 01:20:26,380
I took Kazan, I took Astrakhan,

836
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:29,925
I took Revel,
but never Shpak.

837
01:20:30,217 --> 01:20:32,970
There he is! You're bagged!
It serves you right, drunkard!

838
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:36,932
-What's up, folks? Who are you?
-Lieutenant, I'm this alcoholic's wife!

839
01:20:37,183 --> 01:20:40,728
You're lying!
How can you be my wife, old woman?

840
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:44,648
See? He got drunk out of his wits!
He can't recognize his own wife!

841
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:48,319
I had to call the psychiatric ward.

842
01:20:48,694 --> 01:20:52,865
Oh, that's what it's all about!
That's why all these ravings.

843
01:20:53,157 --> 01:20:57,244
He took Kazan. He took Astrakhan.
He calls himself Ivan the Terrible.

844
01:20:57,536 --> 01:20:59,872
It's delirium tremens.
A typical case.

845
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:03,376
What's the patient's real name?

846
01:21:03,876 --> 01:21:07,463
- Bunsha, Ivan Vassilyevich.
- You're lying, witch!

847
01:21:07,838 --> 01:21:09,757
I hate him!

848
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,134
Attention!

849
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,512
Get ready!

850
01:21:24,355 --> 01:21:26,524
Take the impostors alive!

851
01:21:37,451 --> 01:21:39,745
Black caviar!

852
01:21:41,664 --> 01:21:43,082
Red caviar!

853
01:21:45,292 --> 01:21:47,753
And from overseas, eggplant caviar!

854
01:22:39,972 --> 01:22:43,434
Comrade Timofeyev! Alexander
Sergeyevich! Help me!

855
01:22:44,643 --> 01:22:47,688
Ivan Vassilyevich, hurry up!
Goodbye!

856
01:23:01,619 --> 01:23:05,122
- are You all right?
- All right. You'll never believe it!

857
01:23:05,539 --> 01:23:11,379
The police will believe it! You will
answer for your anti-social experiments!

858
01:23:13,464 --> 01:23:15,549
Sire!
Just a minute!

859
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:30,523
Why do you have police at your door,
comrade scientist?

860
01:23:30,815 --> 01:23:33,359
There was a burglary at your friend
Shpak's today.

861
01:23:33,734 --> 01:23:35,820
Really?

862
01:23:40,408 --> 01:23:45,287
- We detained One more.
- No, not detained!

863
01:23:45,871 --> 01:23:50,126
Not detained. I was on my way
to make a voluntary confession.

864
01:23:50,376 --> 01:23:55,005
I'm delighted to hand myself in to my
dear police. I set on it all my hopes.

865
01:23:55,256 --> 01:23:58,884
- Who are you?
- Bunsha, Ivan Vassilyevich.

866
01:24:00,761 --> 01:24:03,931
So you insist that you're Ivan
Vassilyevich Bunsha?

867
01:24:04,223 --> 01:24:06,183
Your ID, please.

868
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:11,063
- I forgot it at home.
- Who can corroborate your statement?

869
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:17,445
Well, anybody! You may ask my wife,
Ulyana. She will confirm it.

870
01:24:17,737 --> 01:24:19,989
Well, well, well.

871
01:24:20,865 --> 01:24:23,576
What did you want to make
a voluntary confession about?

872
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:28,497
I confess that against my will, under
the compulsion of Prince Miloslavsky,

873
01:24:28,831 --> 01:24:31,250
I acted temporarily as a tsar.

874
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:33,961
A tsar?
You are a tsar, too?

875
01:24:34,253 --> 01:24:36,922
Yes, a tsar.
Ivan Vassilyevich the Terrible.

876
01:24:37,298 --> 01:24:41,177
You're lying, dog!
I am the tsar!

877
01:24:43,054 --> 01:24:44,555
Hooligan!

878
01:24:45,765 --> 01:24:49,643
Everything I've got by working
tirelessly, everything is gone!

879
01:24:50,269 --> 01:24:53,522
Three tape recorders,
three imported movie cameras,

880
01:24:53,773 --> 01:25:00,821
three home-made cigarette cases,
a suede jacket... Three jackets!

881
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:06,911
And they want to be awarded the title
of a house of cultured communal living!

882
01:25:08,746 --> 01:25:13,000
Ulyana Andreyevna, tell us again
who he is.

883
01:25:15,169 --> 01:25:17,296
I've already told you!

884
01:25:17,588 --> 01:25:20,257
My husband, Ivan Vassilyevich Bunsha.

885
01:25:20,466 --> 01:25:24,220
- They'll cure you, alcoholic.
- Fine! Then who is this?

886
01:25:28,766 --> 01:25:32,520
- Impostor!
- You're an impostor yourself! Got it?

887
01:25:32,812 --> 01:25:35,648
- So, who is he?
-My husband! Ivan Vassilyevich Bunsha.

888
01:25:36,649 --> 01:25:42,238
They will cure you, too.

889
01:25:44,448 --> 01:25:50,246
- It turns out you've got 2 husbands?
- So it turns out.

890
01:25:50,538 --> 01:25:52,415
And they're both Bunshas?

891
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:57,169
Yes, both of them.

892
01:26:00,589 --> 01:26:02,967
You'll be cured.

893
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:06,178
And you'll be cured.

894
01:26:09,724 --> 01:26:12,143
And I'll be cured, too.

895
01:26:13,144 --> 01:26:17,440
What you told me is grandiose!
You're such a valuable eyewitness!

896
01:26:18,024 --> 01:26:21,110
If I were you,
I'd put a dissertation in the can.

897
01:26:22,278 --> 01:26:25,114
I ain't in no hurry.
I can end up in the can any time.

898
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:39,545
Is that it? Is that you?
I couldn't hope for anything more.

899
01:26:41,213 --> 01:26:43,716
Ulyana Andreyevna,
I was faithful to you.

900
01:26:43,966 --> 01:26:47,887
The tsarina tried to seduce me,
but I didn't give in. I swear!

901
01:26:55,019 --> 01:26:58,814
- Miloslavsky was almost in our hands!
- George Miloslavsky?

902
01:26:59,065 --> 01:27:01,525
- Yes! Arrest him!
- Right.

903
01:27:03,235 --> 01:27:04,570
Wait!

904
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:09,200
Hold on! Get him!
Catch Miloslavsky!

905
01:27:43,651 --> 01:27:46,821
I was absolutely sure
that I had sent you back.

906
01:27:47,571 --> 01:27:51,117
Hurry up, Prince.
Get your machine working.

907
01:27:51,492 --> 01:27:55,454
- Where have You been all this time?
-The police bagged me. Framing me up.

908
01:28:02,128 --> 01:28:04,964
They're after me, Prince!
Hurry up! Hurry! Oh, my God!

909
01:28:07,425 --> 01:28:10,011
Run, Ivan Vassilyevich!

910
01:28:13,097 --> 01:28:16,100
- Hurry, Ivan Vassilyevich!
- Yes, I'm coming!

911
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:18,519
Oh, God, forgive me my sins!

912
01:28:19,937 --> 01:28:21,772
Evil spirit!

913
01:28:22,732 --> 01:28:28,571
- Farewell, Prince!
- Good luck! Don't think ill of me.

914
01:28:56,682 --> 01:28:59,435
- It's outrageous!
- You put out electricity again!

915
01:28:59,685 --> 01:29:02,688
- He's taunting us!
- We're going to complain!

916
01:29:03,564 --> 01:29:06,442
Oh, you're already out of the asylum?

917
01:29:06,776 --> 01:29:09,695
- Stop your hooliganism!
- What's the matter?

918
01:29:09,987 --> 01:29:11,739
That's scandalous!

919
01:29:12,073 --> 01:29:17,620
He's wearing glasses just for nothing!
You'll be brought to court for that!

920
01:29:20,581 --> 01:29:24,126
We send them to college,
and in return we're going bald!

921
01:29:26,796 --> 01:29:28,255
What was it?

922
01:29:29,006 --> 01:29:33,344
Was it just a dream, or was it real?

923
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:38,516
Ivan the Terrible... Miloslavsky...

924
01:29:40,476 --> 01:29:42,520
Oh, I forgot. Zina has left me.

925
01:29:48,109 --> 01:29:50,611
No, it's all nonsense!

926
01:29:51,654 --> 01:29:54,115
I was just knocked out!

927
01:29:55,991 --> 01:29:57,952
And what if it's not nonsense?

928
01:29:58,786 --> 01:30:01,497
My goodness!
What is going on here?

929
01:30:01,914 --> 01:30:03,916
You smoked again!

930
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,044
And, of course, you didn't eat
your lunch.

931
01:30:16,554 --> 01:30:19,724
- You haven't left for Gagry?
- What do you mean, Gagry?

932
01:30:20,599 --> 01:30:23,644
You're going crazy
with your machine!

933
01:30:29,859 --> 01:30:32,153
Oh, how did you get yourself
such a bump?

934
01:30:35,322 --> 01:30:38,826
Zina, tell me the truth.

935
01:30:39,869 --> 01:30:43,080
- Where have You been?
- At a rehearsal.

936
01:30:43,247 --> 01:30:44,582
All right...

937
01:30:44,832 --> 01:30:49,378
Give me a straight answer.
Are you in love with Yakin?

938
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:55,968
- What Yakin? What is it with You?
- Don't lie to me. He's your director.

939
01:30:57,803 --> 01:31:00,598
We have no director by that name.

940
01:31:03,017 --> 01:31:05,686
- Is it true?
- I swear.

941
01:31:06,645 --> 01:31:07,980
Hurray!

942
01:31:31,045 --> 01:31:32,838
Ciao!

943
01:31:33,297 --> 01:31:36,008
Thank you for your attention!

944
01:31:36,258 --> 01:31:38,177
The End
